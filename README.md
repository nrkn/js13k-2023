JS13K 2023

We are going to rewrite our previous entry, and do the ol' switcheroo.

We will show a fancy intro scene using our new gfx, but then static, an error
message, and the gfx revert to previous Ranger Down game - but with a new
cutscene etc - copy over the ideas from other doc - player sees old 
gfx for a short time until they get their first "upgrade" - surprise, it's not 
Ranger 2018 - now we can diverge into a new storyline based on this year's theme

We won't start story and gameplay until we get the theme, but we can set up the 
engine and etc

Last time we ran out of time long before bytes, so let's give ourselves a better
chance by setting up early
